# Mathematics in Image Processing 

## Description

This project explores the fundamental role of mathematics in image processing techniques. Through a series of MATLAB scripts, various mathematical concepts are applied to manipulate and analyze images, showcasing the intersection of mathematics and digital image processing.

## Requirements

- MATLAB
- Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox
- Image Processing Toolbox

## Usage

- contrast_enhance.m: Utilises histogram equalization for contrast enhancement.
- filtering.m: Explores various filtering techniques including Gaussian smoothing, Laplace filter, and Sobel operator.
- grayscale.m: Converts images to grayscale.
- high_pass.m: Uses Fourier transform for high-pass filtering.
- interpolation.m: Implements nearest neighbor and bilinear interpolation methods.
- low_pass.m: Applies low-pass filtering using Fourier transforms.
- median_filter.m: Utilises median filtering for noise reduction.
- segmentation.m: Demonstrates image segmentation using k-means clustering.
